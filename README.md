# 🗣️ Text to Speech Converter

This is a simple **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Converter Web App** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to enter any text, select a voice, and listen to the text being spoken aloud using the **Web Speech API**.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [text2speech-maneesha.netlify.app](https://text2speech-maneesha.netlify.app)

## 🚀 Features

- 🌍 Supports multiple voices depending on the browser (male/female, different accents).
- 🎨 Clean and modern UI with gradient background.
- 📱 Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile.
- ⚡ Built using only front-end technologies (no backend required).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Structure of the app  
- **CSS3** – Styling (custom gradient theme, interactive UI)
